# D2D-clustering

From the basic code that was provided to us by the ns3 samples, we were tasked to implement a D2D clustering that is based on the distance of the UE's from the eNb. The basic guidelines that we followed was that of the **5G technology**. We also successfully calculated the SINR of the connections. Since we were suceesful in doing so, our next step was to write a paper on the same. The link to the paper is given below : <br>
