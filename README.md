# D2D-clustering

From the basic code that was provided to us by the ns3 samples, we were tasked to implement a D2D clustering that is based on the distance of the UE's from the eNb. The basic guidelines that we followed was that of the 5G technology. We also successfully calculated the SINR of the connections. Since we were suceesful in doing so, our next step was to write a paper on the same. The link to the paper is given below : <br>
